**AI-Powered Open-Source Quantitative Trading Framework for Stocks & Crypto**

---

## 🧭 Overview

**OctoQuant** is an open-source **AI-driven quantitative trading framework** designed for both **stocks** and **cryptocurrencies**. It provides a unified pipeline for **research → backtesting → paper trading → live execution**, emphasizing modularity, transparency, and reproducibility.

With OctoQuant, you can:

* Build and test trading strategies with clean modular APIs.
* Run backtests with realistic transaction costs and slippage.
* Deploy paper/live trading with pluggable broker adapters.
* Extend easily for ML-based signal generation or portfolio optimization.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is for educational and research purposes only. It is **not investment advice**. Always test thoroughly before live trading.

## 🧠 AI Integration Ideas

* **Signal Modeling:** train ML models (XGBoost, LSTM, TSTransformer) for alpha prediction.
* **LLM Integration:** summarize research notebooks, auto-generate experiment logs.
* **Reinforcement Learning:** optimize policy-based trading decisions.
